# Jump to docs for bevy

This is a simple Firefox addon which adds a button to jump to the current sub-crate docs when browsing docs.rs/bevy. This allows one to directly view source etc. and generally increases happiness.

## Installation

You need a "blue" Firefox (developer edition and such), and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config`. Then you can simply drop the zip in this repository to the addons page of your firefox (`about:addons`).
